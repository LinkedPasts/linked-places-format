naive ontology of historical place
	axioms driving Linked Places format (LPF)
	LPF models place attestations
===========================================================================
things that happen(ed) in time
	Events/activity (simple, complex) occur at/within/nearby places at time
things that exist(ed) in time
	Objects exist at at/within/nearby places at time
LPF does *not* model events, non-Place objects (artifacts)
LPF models the locales/settings related to historical phenomena
===========================================================================
Place is the answer to "where?" 
	i.e. occurred at <place> at <time>; existed at <place> at <time>
	polysemous; for WHG it is roughly synonymous with locale and setting
Relevant properties of places include:
	setting (location at time)
		location/extent
			Place <has-location> Location
		temporal extent (aka "when"; known to exist)
			Place <has-when> When
	name (at time; valid period)
		Place <has-name> PlaceName <has-when> When
	type (at time; valid period)
		Place <has-type> PlaceType <has-when> When
	relations
		[Event <occurred-at> Place] <has-when> When 
		[Thing <existed-at> Place]  <has-when> When 
		[Place [<within>|<contains>|<connected-to>|preceded|succeeded] Place] <has-when> When
	links
		Place <close-match> Place
	description
		Place <described-by> PlaceDescription
	depiction
		Place <depicted-by> PlaceDepiction

places have locations/extents at time, whether known and/or specified or not
	multiple locations/extents can be asserted for a place
		varying over time
		by different sources
	coordinate locations
	topology: relative to other places (10km SW of p1; near p2; within p3)
historical gazetteers index attestations of named places
	i.e. references to place retrieved from historical sources

	birth, death, battle, settlement creation, structure creation
<event> occurred at <place>
