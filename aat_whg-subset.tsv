	300008346	Settlements and Landscapes	Settlements and Landscapes	The Settlements and Landscapes hierarchy contains terms for the largest features of the built environment, whether relatively concentrated (e.g., 'retirement communities') or extensive (e.g., 'capital cities'). Settlements are defined as all places or areas, larger than a single dwelling or complex, occupied or modified by human populations and with certain societal functions. Also included in this hierarchy are terms for natural landscape and cultural landscape. By placing natural landscapes in this hierarchy, the AAT has chosen not to emphasize a distinction between the natural environment and the built environment, for which it may be difficult to define a distinction. Relation to other hierarchies: Administrative bodies (e.g., 'nations,' 'provinces') are located in the Organizations hierarchy. Adjectival attributes of some settlements (e.g., 'radial plan') are found in the Associated Concepts hierarchy. Terms referring to individual plants and trees are found in the Living Organisms hierarchy (e.g., 'Pinus (genus)'), while terms for general areas of vegetation (e.g., 'jungles,' 'shrubs') are found here. Terms for infrastructural systems, networks of buildings, other structures, and equipment that constitute physically ordered entities within settlements and landscapes (e.g., 'bus transit systems') are located in the Object Groupings and Systems hierarchy.

300132294	300266059	bodies of water (natural)	bodies of water (natural)	The Settlements and Landscapes hierarchy contains terms for the largest features of the built environment, whether relatively concentrated (e.g., 'retirement communities') or extensive (e.g., 'capital cities'). Settlements are defined as all places or areas, larger than a single dwelling or complex, occupied or modified by human populations and with certain societal functions. Also included in this hierarchy are terms for natural landscape and cultural landscape. By placing natural landscapes in this hierarchy, the AAT has chosen not to emphasize a distinction between the natural environment and the built environment, for which it may be difficult to define a distinction. Relation to other hierarchies: Administrative bodies (e.g., 'nations,' 'provinces') are located in the Organizations hierarchy. Adjectival attributes of some settlements (e.g., 'radial plan') are found in the Associated Concepts hierarchy. Terms referring to individual plants and trees are found in the Living Organisms hierarchy (e.g., 'Pinus (genus)'), while terms for general areas of vegetation (e.g., 'jungles,' 'shrubs') are found here. Terms for infrastructural systems, networks of buildings, other structures, and equipment that constitute physically ordered entities within settlements and landscapes (e.g., 'bus transit systems') are located in the Object Groupings and Systems hierarchy.
300266059	300008678	harbor	harbors	Well-sheltered inlets of water affording protection from wind and sea and sufficient depth to allow anchorage for vessels.
300266059	300132312	riverine bodies of water	riverine bodies of water	Bodies of flowing water moving in one direction, including streams and rivers.
300132312	300008707	river	rivers	Bodies of water flowing in direct course or a series of divergents or converging channels.
300132312	300008736	waterfall	waterfalls	Perpendicular or very steep descents of the water of a stream. May be used for artificial waterfalls only if highly naturalistic in form and context; otherwise prefer 'cascades' or 'fountains.'
300132312	300008697	spring	springs (bodies of water)	Water issuing naturally from the rock or soil upon the land or into a body of surface water.
300266059	300008899	wetland	wetlands	Large category including areas of land characterized by poor drainage, standing or slowly moving water, and as a result, an almost constant state of water-saturated soil. Wetlands include swamps, marshes, and bogs.
300266059	300132316	bay	bays (bodies of water)	Denotes wide, open, curving indentations of a shoreline, larger than coves and smaller than gulfs.

300266059	300008694	sea	seas	The shallower salt water areas of the earth lying on the margins of continents; loosely applied as a proper name to any specific bodies of water. For the main water areas of the earth, lying in basins, use 'oceans.'
300266059	300266571	estuary	estuaries	Category of marine body of water comprising areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge with the ocean. This mixing of waters with such different salt concentrations creates a very interesting and unique ecosystem.
